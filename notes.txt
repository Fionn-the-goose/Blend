Work Prozess:
    - I startet something i didnt save which killed a shitload of time so I made this in a bit off a rush sadly
    - I will send the link to the cloud and everything at 12 but work more afterwords and put it in a seperate folder
    - I start by seperating the model on three parts:
        - barrel
        - end part
        - handle
    - defining the generell shape of everything, leaving out plastic parts
    - Made a mess with the barrel, by adding a boolean modefier accidentely
    - thankfully grid fill exists dor that though
    - used circle tools add on for the barrel
    - then it was just adding a bunch of loop cuts and defining the shape
    - added some really simple textures thue to time
    - noticed to late that the front and my model doesnt add up that well sadly
    - When I arrived at the plastic parts of the gun i was in a rush so i eyeballed some stuff
